# Configuration parameters for FLANN based matcher

# The FLANN method to use (described in the FLANN namespace). As a note,
# currently selecting a method will set up the FLANN matcher with
# default parameters.
#
# Options:
# 1: FLANN::KDTree: kd-tree separation
# 2: FLANN::KMeans: k-means clustering.
# 3: FLANN::Composite: Combines the above methods.
# 4: FLANN::LSH: Locality-sensitive hash table separation.
#
# Recommended: 1 (FLANN::KDTree).
#
flann_method: 1

# Determines whether to use a k-nearest-neighbours match.
#
# Matcher can conduct a knn match with the best 2 matches for each
# descriptor. This uses the ratio test (@param ratio_threshold)
# to discard outliers.
#
# If false, the matcher uses a distance heuristic
# (@param distance_threshold) to discard poor matches. This also
# incorporates cross checking between matches.
#
# Recommended: true.
#
use_knn: true

# Specifies heuristic for the ratio test, illustrated by Dr. David G. Lowe
# in his paper _Distinctive Image Features from Scale-Invariant Keypoints_
# (2004). The test takes the ratio of the closest keypoint distance
# to that of the second closest neighbour. If the ratio is less than
# the heuristic, it is discarded. Only used if use_knn is true.
#
# A value of 0.8 was shown by Dr. Lowe to reject 90% of the false matches, and
# discard only 5% of the correct matches.
#
# Recommended: 0.8. Must be between 0 and 1.
#
ratio_threshold: 0.8

# Specifies the distance threshold for good matches.
#
# Matches will only be kept if the descriptor distance is less than or
# equal to the product of the distance threshold and the _minimum_ of all
# descriptor distances. The greater the value, the more matches will
# be kept. Only used if use_knn is false.
#
# Recommended: 5. Must be greater than or equal to zero.
#
distance_threshold: 5

# Determines whether to automatically remove outliers using the method
# described in fm_method.
#
# If true, the wave::BruteForceMatcher::matchDescriptors method will
# automatically call the wave::BruteForceMatcher::removeOutliers method,
# which uses the method in wave::BFMatcherParams::fm_method to remove
# matched outliers.
#
# If false, the matches returned will only have been passed through the
# distance threshold or ratio tests described above.
#
# Recommended: True
#
remove_outliers: true

#  Method to find the fundamental matrix and remove outliers.
#
#  Options:
#  1: cv::FM_7POINT, 7-point algorithm
#  2: cv::FM_8POINT, 8-point algorithm
#  4: cv::FM_LMEDS, least-median algorithm
#  8: cv::FM_RANSAC, RANSAC algorithm
#
#  Recommended: 8 (cv::FM_RANSAC).
#
fm_method: 8
