# Configuration parameters for Brute Force matcher

# Norm type to use for distance calculation between feature descriptors.
#
#  Options:
#  1: cv::NORM_INF, l-infinity norm
#  2: cv::NORM_L1: l1 norm
#  4: cv::NORM_L2: l2 norm
#  5: cv::NORM_L2SQR: l2 norm, squared
#  6: cv::NORM_HAMMING: Hamming distance
#  7: cv::NORM_HAMMING2:
#
#  As per OpenCV docs, NORM_L1 and NORM_L2 is valid for the SIFT or
#  SURF descriptors, while NORM_HAMMING is valid for the ORB, BRISK, and
#  BRIEF descriptors. NORM_HAMMING2 should only be used with ORB, when
#  WTA_K is 3 or 4.
#
#  Default: NORM_HAMMING, since currently only BRISK Descriptor is used.
#
#  Please refer to further description of the norm types
#  [here][opencv_norm_types].

norm_type: 6

# This boolean enables or disables the cross-checking functionality, which
# looks to remove false matches. If true, the closest match to
# descriptor_1 from descriptor_2 will only be reported if the object in
# descriptor_2 is also the closest to descriptor_1.
#
# Must be __false__ if ratio_rejection is true, and vice versa!
#
# Recommended: false
cross_check: false

# Determines whether to use the ratio test or threshold-based distance
# heuristic for outlier rejection.
#
# Must be __false__ if cross_check is true, and vice versa!
#
# Recommended: true
ratio_rejection: true

# Specifies heuristic for the ratio test, illustrated by Dr. David G. Lowe
# in his paper _Distinctive Image Features from Scale-Invariant Keypoints_
# (2004). The test takes the ratio of the closest keypoint distance
# to that of the second closest neighbour. If the ratio is greater than the
# heuristic, it is discarded.
#
# A value of 0.8 was shown by Dr. Lowe to reject 90% of the false matches,
# and discard only 5% of the correct matches.
#
# Recommended: 0.8. Must be between 0 and 1. Only used if ratio_rejection is true.
ratio_test_heuristic: 0.8

# Specifies the rejection heuristic for good matches.
#
# Matches will only be kept if the descriptor distance is less than or
# equal to the product of the rejection heuristic and the _minimum_ of all
# descriptor distances. The greater the heuristic, the more matches will
# be kept.
#
# Recommended: 5. Must be greater than or equal to zero. Only used if
# ratio_rejection is false.

rejection_heuristic: 5
