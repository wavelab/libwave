# Configuration parameters for Brute Force matcher

#  Norm type to use for distance calculation between feature descriptors.
#
#  Options:
#  1: cv::NORM_INF, l-infinity norm
#  2: cv::NORM_L1: l1 norm
#  4: cv::NORM_L2: l2 norm
#  5: cv::NORM_L2SQR: l2 norm, squared
#  6: cv::NORM_HAMMING: Hamming distance
#  7: cv::NORM_HAMMING2:
#
#  As per OpenCV docs, NORM_L1 and NORM_L2 is valid for the SIFT or
#  SURF descriptors, while NORM_HAMMING is valid for the ORB, BRISK, and
#  BRIEF descriptors. NORM_HAMMING2 should only be used with ORB, when
#  WTA_K is 3 or 4.
#
#  Default: NORM_HAMMING, since currently only BRISK Descriptor is used.
#
#  Please refer to further description of the norm types
#  [here][opencv_norm_types].

norm_type: 6

# Determines whether to use a k-nearest-neighbours match.
#
# Matcher can conduct a knn match with the best 2 matches for each
# descriptor. This uses the ratio test (@param ratio_threshold)
# to discard outliers.
#
# If false, the matcher uses a distance heuristic
# (@param distance_threshold) to discard poor matches. This also
# incorporates cross checking between matches.
#
# Recommended: true.
#
use_knn: true

# Specifies heuristic for the ratio test, illustrated by Dr. David G. Lowe
# in his paper _Distinctive Image Features from Scale-Invariant Keypoints_
# (2004). The test takes the ratio of the closest keypoint distance
# to that of the second closest neighbour. If the ratio is less than
# the heuristic, it is discarded.
#
# A value of 0.8 was shown by Dr. Lowe to reject 90% of the false matches, and
# discard only 5% of the correct matches.
#
# Recommended: 0.8. Must be between 0 and 1.
#
ratio_threshold: 0.8

# Specifies the distance threshold for good matches.
#
# Matches will only be kept if the descriptor distance is less than or
# equal to the product of the distance threshold and the _minimum_ of all
# descriptor distances. The greater the value, the more matches will
# be kept.
#
# Recommended: 5. Must be greater than or equal to zero.
#
distance_threshold: 5

#  Method to find the fundamental matrix and remove outliers.
#
#  Options:
#  1: cv::FM_7POINT, 7-point algorithm
#  2: cv::FM_8POINT, 8-point algorithm
#  4: cv::FM_LMEDS, least-median algorithm
#  8: cv::FM_RANSAC, RANSAC algorithm
#
#  Recommended: 8 (cv::FM_RANSAC).
#
fm_method: 8
