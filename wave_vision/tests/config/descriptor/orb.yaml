# Configuration parameters for ORB Descriptor Extractor

# The number of points that compose the ORB descriptor. A value of 2
# constructs the descriptor by comparing the brightnesses of a random pair
# of points. Other values are 3 or 4; 3 will use 3 random points, and 4
# similarly will use 4 random points. For these last two options, the
# output result will be 2 bits, as the result is the index of the
# brightest point (0, 1, 2, 3). Thus, the distance method used for the
# BruteForceMatcher or FLANNMatcher will have to be cv::NORM_HAMMING_2, a
# variation to the Hamming distance, when tuple_size = 3 or 4.
#
# OpenCV refers to this as "WTA_K." tuple_size is the description from Kaehler
# and Bradski's book: "Learning OpenCV3: Computer Vision in C++ with the OpenCV
# Library."
#
# Options: 2, 3, or 4.
#
# Default: 2.
#
tuple_size: 2

# The size of the square patch used in the random point sampling to
# construct the descriptor. This patch is smoothed using an integral
# image.
#
# Default: 31 (31 x 31 pixels). Must be greater than 0.
#
patch_size: 31
