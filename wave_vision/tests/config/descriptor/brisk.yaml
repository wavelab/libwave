# Configuration parameters for BRISK Descriptor Extractor

# radius_list defines the radius of each subsequent circle (in pixels). All
# numbers must be positive. Cannot be empty.
#
# Default: radius_list: [0.0, 2.465, 4.165, 6.29, 9.18]
radius_list: [0.0, 2.465, 4.165, 6.29, 9.18]

# number_list defines the number of points in each circle. Must be the same
# size as radius_list. All numbers must be positive. Cannot be empty.
#
# Default: number_list: [1, 10, 14, 15, 20]
number_list: [1, 10, 14, 15, 20]

# d_max and d_min are threshold distances to classify a pair of points as a
# long pair or a short pair. Short pairs are not used in the brightness
# comparison, due to balancing effects of local gradients. The long pairs are
# not used in the assembly of the bit vector descriptor.
#
# The value of d_max must be less than that of d_min.
#
# Default: d_max = 5.85, d_min = 8.2.
d_max: 5.85
d_min: 8.2
