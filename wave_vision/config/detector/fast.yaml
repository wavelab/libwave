# FAST Detector Configuration Parameters

# Threshold on difference between intensity of the central pixel, and pixels
# in a circle (Bresenham radius 3) around this pixel. Value must be greater than
# zero.
#
# Recommended: 10
#
threshold: 10

# Removes keypoints in adjacent locations.
#
# Recommended: true
#
nonmax_suppression: true

# Neighbourhood, as defined in the paper by Rosten. TYPE_N_M refers to
# the pixel circumference (M) and number of consecutive pixels (N) that
# must be brighter or darker than the center pixel for the algorithm to
# deem the point as a corner.
#
# Options:
# 0: cv::FastFeatureDetector::TYPE_5_8
# 1: cv::FastFeatureDetector::TYPE_7_12
# 2: cv::FastFeatureDetector::TYPE_9_16 (recommended)

type: 2
