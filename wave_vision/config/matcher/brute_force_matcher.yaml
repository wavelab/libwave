# Configuration parameters for Brute Force matcher

# Norm type to use for distance calculation between feature descriptors.
#
#  Options:
#  1: cv::NORM_INF, l-infinity norm
#  2: cv::NORM_L1: l1 norm
#  4: cv::NORM_L2: l2 norm
#  5: cv::NORM_L2SQR: l2 norm, squared
#  6: cv::NORM_HAMMING: Hamming distance
#  7: cv::NORM_HAMMING2:
#
#  As per OpenCV docs, NORM_L1 and NORM_L2 is valid for the SIFT or
#  SURF descriptors, while NORM_HAMMING is valid for the ORB, BRISK, and
#  BRIEF descriptors. NORM_HAMMING2 should only be used with ORB, when
#  WTA_K is 3 or 4.
#
#  Default: NORM_HAMMING, since currently only BRISK Descriptor is used.
#
#  Please refer to further description of the norm types
#  [here][opencv_norm_types].

norm_type: 6

# This boolean enables or disables the cross-checking functionality, which
# looks to remove false matches. If true, the closest match to
# descriptor_1 from descriptor_2 will only be reported if the object in
# descriptor_2 is also the closest to descriptor_1.
#
# Recommended: false
#
cross_check: false
