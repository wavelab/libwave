# libwave
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wavelab/libwave.png?branch=master)][1]

This library contains reusable code for:

- Estimation
- Kinematics
- Optimization
- Vision
- and more ..

## Requirements

`libwave` is divided into modules which can be built separately.
Each has its own dependecies.

| Module             | Dependencies |
| ------------------ | ------------ |
| wave\_benchmark    | wave\_containers, wave\_geometry, wave\_utils |
| wave\_containers   | Eigen, Boost |
| wave\_controls     | Eigen |
| wave\_geography    | Eigen, GeographicLib |
| wave\_geometry     | Eigen, Boost |
| wave\_gtsam        | wave\_utils, gtsam |
| wave\_kinematics   | wave\_utils, wave\_controls |
| wave\_matching     | wave\_utils, Boost, PCL  |
| wave\_optimization | wave\_utils, wave\_kinematics, wave\_vision, Ceres |
| wave\_utils        | Eigen, yaml-cpp |
| wave\_vision       | wave\_utils, wave\_kinematics, wave\_containers, Boost Filesystem, OpenCV (calib3d, features2d, highgui, imgproc, videoio) |


The following versions are the minimum we test against.
Some earlier versions may work, but are not tested.

- Boost 1.54
- Ceres 1.13
- Eigen 3.3.2
- OpenCV 3.2.0
- PCL 1.8
- yaml-cpp 0.5.1
- gtsam
- GeographicLib 1.49

Building libwave requires CMake 3.2 and a C++11 compiler (tested on GCC 5.4).

### Installing dependencies
The basic set of dependencies can be installed with the Ubuntu package manager
using the command

    sudo apt-get install libboost-dev libyaml-cpp-dev libeigen3-dev \
    build-essential cmake

For convenience, scripts to install other dependencies on Ubuntu 16.04 are
provided in `scripts/install`. **Note**: the scripts are not tested on a wide
variety of systems. They may be incompatible with other packages installed on
your system.

## Install from source

Clone the repo with submodules:

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/wavelab/libwave.git

Install the dependencies required for the modules you want to build, as
described above. Then build using CMake:

    cd libwave
    mkdir -p build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make -j8
    
By default, all libraries whose dependencies are found will be built. Individual
libraries can be disabled using CMake options. For example,

    cmake .. -DBUILD_wave_vision=OFF
    
will disable building `wave_vision`.

Install libwave by running `make install`. Alternatively, you can enable the
`EXPORT_BUILD` option in CMake, which will make the libwave build directory 
searchable by CMake without installation.


**Known issue with OpenCV**: `wave_vision` may
[fail to build](https://github.com/wavelab/libwave/issues/267) if OpenCV 2 is
installed in the default system directory on Ubuntu 16.04 (and OpenCV 3 is
installed elsewhere). A workaround is to remove OpenCV 2 via
`sudo apt remove libopencv-dev`.


## Use with CMake

One libwave has been either installed or exported by CMake, it can be used in
your project's `CMakeLists.txt` file as follows:

    cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0)
    project(example)

    find_package(wave REQUIRED geometry matching)

    add_executable(example example.cpp)
    target_link_libraries(example wave::geometry wave::matching)


## Documentation

The documentation consists of an API reference as well as pages on Fundamentals,
describing concepts and theory behind the library.

It is generated using Doxygen, using the build target `make doc`.


## Notes for Developers

To expedite our development process we use a set of git hooks to run:

- Clang format (pre-commit)

these can be activated by running the `githook_init.bash` from the root of the repo

    bash scripts/githooks/githooks_init.bash
