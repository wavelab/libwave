# Ceres Tutorial
As with all nonlinear-optimizers they can be difficult to master, in the following we give examples on how to effectively implement custom cost functions in Ceres-Solver. In particular we will cover several different topics:

- How do I define a cost function?
- How do I define the optimization problem?
- How do I define a numerical cost function?
- How do I define an analytical cost function?
- How do I load the optimization data?


## How do I define a cost function?
Ceres can solve bounds constrained robustified non-linear least squares problems of the form

\begin{align}
  \min_{\mathbf{x}} &\quad \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i} \rho_i\left(\left\|f_i\left(x_{i_1}, ... ,x_{i_k}\right)\right\|^2\right) \\
    \text{s.t.} &\quad l_j \le x_j \le u_j
\end{align}

The expression
$\rho_i\left(\left\|f_i\left(x_{i_1},...,x_{i_k}\right)\right\|^2\right)$ is known as a `ResidualBlock`, where $f_i(\cdot)$ is a `CostFunction` that depends on the parameter blocks $\left[x_{i_1},... , x_{i_k}\right]$. In most optimization problems small groups of scalars occur together. For example the three components of a translation vector and the four components of the quaternion that define the pose of a camera. We refer to such a group of small scalars as a `ParameterBlock`. Of course a `ParameterBlock` can just be a single parameter. $l_j$ and $u_j$ are bounds on the parameter block $x_j$.

$\rho_i$ is a `LossFunction`. A `LossFunction` is a scalar function that is used to reduce the influence of outliers on the solution of non-linear least squares problems.

As a special case, when $\rho_i(x) = x$, i.e., the identity function, and $l_j = -\infty$ and $u_j = \infty$ we get the more familiar `non-linear least squares problem:

\begin{equation}
  \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i} \left\|f_i\left(x_{i_1}, ... ,x_{i_k}\right)\right\|^2
\end{equation}

**Example** consider the problem of finding the minimum of the function:

\begin{equation}
  \dfrac{1}{2} (10 - x)^{2}
\end{equation}

**Important**: In Ceres while implementing the `CostFunction` you as the user are expected to implement the **residual only** because the cost function is always contructed the same way ($\text{cost} = \sum \text{residuals}^{2}$).

\begin{equation}
  r = (10 - x)
\end{equation}

The minimum is located at $x = 10$ and in Ceres **this is what you are going to implement**, like so:

    struct CostFunctor {
      template <typename T>
      bool operator()(const T* const x, T* residual) const {
        residual[0] = T(10.0) - x[0];
        return true;
      }
    };

Keypoints to the example code:

- In Ceres a cost function implementation is a functor (function objects: a plain old C++ object plus the `()` operator), this is essentially so that the ceres solver can call your cost function with the overridded `()` operator you implemented. This is where you will add your custom residual function, for more information on functors see [this][stack_overflow-functors].
- It is **important to note in Ceres we only define the residual** when implementing the cost functor, because the cost function always is constructed the same way ($\text{cost} = \sum \text{residuals}^{2}$).
- The output of your cost function is written to `residual[0]`, in all cases `residual` is always an array of type `T`, further in this example we are only writing to `residual[0]` because the output dimension for our scalar cost function is 1.
- `x[0]` is of size 1 for this problem because the dimension of `x` is 1.
- The `operator()` is a templated method, which assumes that all its inputs and outputs are of some type `T`. The use of templating here allows Ceres to call `CostFunctor::operator<T>()`, with `T=double` when just the value of the residual is needed, and with a special type `T=Jet` when the Jacobians are needed.
- Because of the special `Jet` type that Ceres uses, one cannot pass in `Eigen::Vector` or `Eigen::Matrix`, the type of template `T` has to be a C++ primitive.
- The functor can be implemented using a `struct` as above, or with `class` either will work (as we will see later).
- Since the cost function contains template code it has to reside in a header file.


## How do I define the optimization problem?
In the previous section we have showed how one defines a cost function, here we will describe how one uses the cost function by setting up the optimization problem in Ceres.

    // The variable to solve for with its initial value.
    double initial_x = 5.0;
    double x = initial_x;

    // Build the problem.
    ceres::Problem problem;

    // Set up the only cost function (also known as residual). This uses
    // auto-differentiation to obtain the derivative (jacobian).
    ceres::CostFunction *cost_function =
        new ceres::AutoDiffCostFunction<CostFunctor, 1, 1>(new CostFunctor);
    problem.AddResidualBlock(cost_function, NULL, &x);

    // Run the solver!
    ceres::Solver::Options options;
    ceres::Solver::Summary summary;

    options.linear_solver_type = ceres::DENSE_QR;
    options.minimizer_progress_to_stdout = true;
    Solve(options, &problem, &summary);

    std::cout << summary.BriefReport() << "\n";
    std::cout << "x : " << initial_x << " -> " << x << "\n";

Note that:

    ceres::CostFunction *cost_function
        = new ceres::AutoDiffCostFunction<CostFunctor, 1, 1>(new CostFunctor);
                               ^              ^        ^  ^
                               |              |        |  |
    Automatic Differentiation -+              |        |  |
    Your custom cost functor  ----------------+        |  |
    Dimension of residual -----------------------------+  |
    Dimension of x ---------------------------------------+

The `ceres::AutoDiffCostFunction` takes our `CostFunctor` previously defined as input, automatically differentiates it and gives it a `ceres::CostFunction` interface.

Running the above code example gives us:

    iter      cost      cost_change  |gradient|   |step|    tr_ratio  tr_radius  ls_iter  iter_time  total_time

## How do I define a numerical cost function?
Defining a numerical cost function is just a matter of using `ceres::NumericDiffCostFunction`, for more info see this [doc][ceres-numerical_diff].

    ceres::CostFunction *cost_function
        = new ceres::NumericDiffCostFunction<MyScalarCostFunctor, CENTRAL, 1, 2, 2>(
            new MyScalarCostFunctor(1.0));                           ^     ^  ^  ^
                                                                     |     |  |  |
                                  Finite Differencing Scheme --------+     |  |  |
                                  Dimension of residual -------------------+  |  |
                                  Dimension of x -----------------------------+  |
                                  Dimension of y --------------------------------+



## How do I define an analytical cost function?
The implementation for an analytical cost function is more involving compared to a numerical or automatic differentiated cost function. First we have to implement the analytical cost function using `ceres::SizedCostFunction`. In this example, we implement the `CostFunction` by calculating the residual between $x$ and $10$, and the loss function is the identity, for definitions of residuals, cost and loss functions, see "How do I define a cost function?" above.


    class AnalyticalCostFunction
      : public SizedCostFunction<1 /* number of residuals */,
                                 1 /* size of first parameter */> {
    public:
      virtual ~AnalyticalCostFunction() {}
      virtual bool Evaluate(double const * const * parameters,
                            double *residuals,
                            double **jacobians) const {
        double x = parameters[0][0];
        // f(x) = 10 - x.
        residuals[0] = 10 - x;

        // f'(x) = -1. Since there's only 1 parameter and that parameter
        // has 1 dimension, there is only 1 element to fill in the
        // jacobians.
        //
        // Since the Evaluate function can be called with the jacobians
        // pointer equal to NULL, the Evaluate function must check to see
        // if jacobians need to be computed.
        //
        // For this simple problem it is overkill to check if jacobians[0]
        // is NULL, but in general when writing more complex
        // CostFunctions, it is possible that Ceres may only demand the
        // derivatives w.r.t. a subset of the parameter blocks.
        if (jacobians != NULL && jacobians[0] != NULL) {
          jacobians[0][0] = -1;
        }
        return true;
      }
    };

Keypoints:

- Instead of overriding the `()` operator, with a `SizedCostFunction` we override the `Evaluate()` method.
- `parameters` contains all the data for the cost function.
- The jacobian for the cost function should be calculated when `jacobians` is not `NULL`
- Dimensions for residuals and parameters are now defined in the inherited class typecast

After defining the cost function to use it you simply do:

    ceres::CostFunction *cost_function = new AnalyticalCostFunction;


## How do I load the optimization data?
The examples we have seen until now are simple optimization problems with no data. The original purpose of least squares and non-linear least squares analysis was fitting curves to data. It is only appropriate that we now consider an example of such a problem. Lets consider a curve fitting problem of the form:

\begin{equation}
    y = e^{mx + c}
\end{equation}

We begin by defining a templated object to evaluate the residual, for specific definitions of residual, cost and loss functions see "How do I define a cost function?" above. Implementing the residual for $y = e^{mx + c}$ we obtain a cost functor that looks something like this:

    struct CurveFittingResidual {
      CurveFittingResidual(double x, double y)
          : x(x), y(y) {}

      template <typename T>
      bool operator()(const T* const m, const T* const c, T* residual) const {
        residual[0] = T(this->y) - exp(m[0] * T(this->x) + c[0]);
        return true;
      }

    private:
      // Observations for a sample.
      const double x;
      const double y;
    };

where we are calculating the residual between $y$ and $e^{mx + c}$. The key-point to note is we are using the private `x` and `y` member variables to store an observation. Assuming the observations are in a `2n` sized array called `data` the problem construction is a simple matter of creating a `ceres::CostFunction` for every observation.

    double m = 0.0;
    double c = 0.0;

    ceres::Problem problem;
    for (int i = 0; i < kNumObservations; ++i) {
      ceres::CostFunction* cost_function =
          new ceres::AutoDiffCostFunction<CurveFittingResidual, 1, 1, 1>(
              new CurveFittingResidual(data[2 * i], data[2 * i + 1]));
      problem.AddResidualBlock(cost_function, NULL, &m, &c);
    }

Running the above code would yeild:

    iter      cost      cost_change  |gradient|   |step|    tr_ratio  tr_radius  ls_iter  iter_time  total_time

    Ceres Solver Report: Iterations: 13, Initial cost: 1.211734e+02, Final cost: 1.056751e+00, Termination: CONVERGENCE
    Initial m: 0 c: 0
    Final   m: 0.291861 c: 0.131439

Ceres finds a solution $m=0.291861,c=0.131439$with an objective function value of $1.05675$. These values are a bit different than the parameters of the original model $m=0.3,c=0.1$, but this is expected. When reconstructing a curve from noisy data, we expect to see such deviations. To verify the results run the `runCurveFittingExample()` in `wave_optimization/src/ceres/ceres_examples.cpp` and then input the values for $m$ and $c$ while executing the python script `scripts/plot/ceres_curve_fitting_example.py` to plot something similar to the figure below.
