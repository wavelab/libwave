# - Config file for the Wave package
#
# This file exports a Wave::<module> target for each present module of libwave.
# The Wave::wave target includes all available modules. Use these tagets with
# the TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES command.
#
# The following variables are also defined, but are not recommended:
#  WAVE_INCLUDE_DIRS - include directories
#  WAVE_LIBRARIES    - libraries to link against
#

# This file contains definitions of IMPORTED targets
INCLUDE ("${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/WaveTargets.cmake")

# Set old-fashioned variables - use only if necessary for older versions of
# CMake which do not support imported targets.
SET(WAVE_LIBRARIES "@WAVE_LIBRARIES@")
SET(WAVE_INCLUDE_DIRS "@WAVE_INCLUDE_DIRS@")
